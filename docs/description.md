# Create Project Write-Up

Our project is a command line interface that can be interacted with to either solve a pre/post-fix equation given user input.
Our interface will have options for evaluation given data again. Roberts wrote prefix solutions, I wrote a post-fix evaluation,
and we are both helping create the program a command line interface.

Example:

	robertskalnins@Robertss-MacBook-Pro ~/Documents/kamsc/apcs-create/build/libs java -jar apcs-create.jar "- + 3 2 * 5 5"

		Solution:  -20
